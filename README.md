# WarSimulator2.0
Game that will simulate wars happened in the past. In the game we will have two sides and and many formation types. The goal is to update the already existing WarSimulator and
create a Genetic Algorithm with wich we can deduce the type of soldiers that fought in a real war based on the number of deceased units in each army.
